<h2>Need Funds</h2>

<p>
    In order to perform actions you need Bitcoin Cash to pay for the transactions.
</p>

<p>
    Please send some BCH to your address: <b>{{ .Key.GetAddress.GetEncoded }}</b>
</p>

<p>
    You don't need much to begin, actions cost less than one cent each.
</p>

<p>
    If you don't have any BCH, try visiting a faucet like
    <a href="https://free.bitcoin.com/" target="_blank">free.bitcoin.com</a>.
